WinSnapCTC (WinSnap Copy To Clipboard)

WinSnapCTC is designed to copy a specified string to the
clipboard after a screenshot has been taken in WinSnap. This is
handy if you save your screenshots in a location hosted on a web
server - you can then copy the URL at which the new image can be
reached to the clipboard for easy sharing.

Usage:
WinSnapCTC.exe [format-string] [image-path]

The basename of the image is extracted from image-path, and "{0}"
in format-string is then replaced with the resulting value. That
whole string is then copied to the clipboard.

To use it, set "Run the following command after saving image on
disk" in the "Saving" section of WinSnap's settings to something
like this:
DRIVE:\path\to\WinSnapCTC.exe "http://example.com/screenshots/{0}" "%IMGPATH%"
